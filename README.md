# ReMarkdown

ReMarkdown is a stylesheet that makes HTML look like raw Markdown text.
Take a look at the [online demo and documentation](https://fvsch.github.io/remarkdown/).

Markdown is [a plain-text syntax by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). This project also takes inspiration from variants such as PHP Markdown Extra and GitHub Flavored Markdown.
